Machine Code:

- Computers only understand binary 0's and 1's more commonly known as machine code.
- These pattern's of 0's and 1's output letters, characters, commands and instructions.
- A compiler is what converts one language into another. For this instance it'll be from source code (C) to machine code.

C library:

- A lot of the functionality is tucked away in separate files
- #include tells the compiler to include certain functions such as printf.
- In C we are calling <stdio.h> as this contains the functions we need.
- A library which is code that someone else wrote.
- A header file is a file that ends in .h that gives access to certain functions.
- Manual pages are textual files to learn how functions works.
- %s is used to print a string of characters.
- <stdio.h> means standard io.h which means standard input and output e.g. stuff involving the screen and the keyboard.

Conditionals:

- Conditionals are what we use to make a decision in a program.

Variables:

- counter = counter + 1 can be rewritten as counter++

Integer overflow:

- Integers can only count so high before it runs out of bits.

Type casting:

- Converting one type to another, so treating one type like it's another, such as changing integer to float.

Floating-Point Imprecision:

- If integer overflow only go so far high before running out of bits then floating point imprecision shows inaccuracy due to memory.
