Compiling:

- Compiling is the process of taking source code and converting it into assembly code.
- preprocessing converts all hash include lines and other's to their equivalent.
- Compiling converts the C code to assembly code, assembling step converts assembly code, i.e 0's and 1's.
- The final step which is linking, combines all the 0's and 1's from all files involved, links them all together.

Memory:

- 8 bits in one byte.
- bool, 1 byte
- int, 4 bytes
- long, 8 bytes
- float, 4 bytes
- double, 8 bytes
- char, 1 byte
- string, ? bytes

String:

- A sequence of characters

Exit Status:

- These are codes the software provides to map the error in the program.

Cryptography:

- The ability to send information security, the art and science of encrypting.
- encryption means to scramble information.
- plain text is readable text
- cipher text is what plain text gets converted to before it's handed off.
- a cipher is an algorithm for encrypting in a reversible way.
- a key is involved typically as a big number that shifts plain text to ciphertext.
- ROT13 is a Caesar cipher with a key of 13.
